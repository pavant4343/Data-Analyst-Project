- POWERBI: DAX calculations.
- TABLEAU: Making funnel chart.
- SQL: Importing the data and changing the data types Of columns correctly.A few times, I had to import because the source file didn’t have an underscore in column names.

## Conclusion
- These charts are tracking performance in three areas: Cross Sell, New Sales, and Renewals.
- The chart visually indicates that the majority of policies are currently active, but there is still a significant portion that remains inactive.
- The dashboard provides an insightful look at sales performance across three key areas- Cross Sell, New Sales, and Renewals.
